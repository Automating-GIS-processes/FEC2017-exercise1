# Automating GIS processes/ FEC 2017 / Exercise 1

# Exercise-1:

This exercises is meant to help you better understand data types and lists in Python, and practice saving files to GitHub.
Below you have a series of "problems" in which you will be asked to either download and modify, or create new script files.
After making you changes, you will need to upload them to GitHub.

The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the end of this document in the [section titled Answers](#answers).

## Problem 1 - What is the favourite treat of Garfield?

Your first task for this week is to make some modifications to the broken script [`cattreats.py`](cattreats.py) that is included in this week's exercise.
The script should allow users to find a cat's favorite treat by setting the `SelectedCat` variable.
Fix this script so that it works as expected, and don't worry about the case of a user entering a cat name that is not on the list.

###Here are the basic steps of manually downloading a script-file from GitHub:
1. Open the script [`cattreats.py`](cattreats.py) in GitHub
2. Press "Raw" at the top of the script
3. Right-click on the page and select Save Page As...
4. Navigate to your local folder and save the file (keep the original name cattreats.py!)

Now you should open the script in Spyder and fix it. After major fixes, or at least once you are done, remember to upload your file back to GitHub!

### Here is how you can upload your modified script manually to GitHub:
1. Click "Upload Files"
2. Add the file (Drag and drop or browse..)
3. Add a message under "Commit changes", for example ""
4. Click "Commit changes"



## Problem 2 - Modifying the Readme.md -file
In this task you will practice how to make some changes to this `README.md` using the Markdown-syntax.

1. Under the heading for Problem 1 (`## Problem 1`), list the changes you needed to make to the code (in regular English, not Python code) to get it working.
You are welcome to use a numbered list if you like. You can read about how to format numbered lists on the GitHub page about [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).


3. Add a heading for Problem 3 and beneath it give your comments about this week's lesson.

    - What did you like?
    - What did you dislike?
    - What would you change?

4. Lastly, just for fun and a bit of practice, add an image of a map that you like along with a short caption describing it's content.
You can add an image by linking to a website, or by uploading an image to your GitHub repository and linking to that.

Since we've spoken briefly about software licencing, we suggest that you search for images in a repository that includes licencing information such as [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) or [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).
You are, of course, also welcome to upload your own images.


# Answers
## This is a sub-heading
This is some text.
You can use *italics* or **bold** text easily.
You may want to read a bit more about [formatting text in Github-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).
You can see an example of how to display an image with a caption below.
