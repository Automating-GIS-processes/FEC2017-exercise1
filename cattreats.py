#!/usr/bin/env python3
'''cattreats.py

This simple script finds the location of a selected cat's name in one list and
its favorite treat at the corresponding location in another. Both items are
printed to the screen afterward.

Limitations:
This code will not work if the cat's name is not in list of cat names.

Usage: ./cattreats.py

# FIX 1: Set a value for the selected cat (you need to insert the name of the cat)
SelectedCat =

# Create and fill lists of cats and treats
Cats = ['Garfield', 'Nermal', 'Tom Cat', 'Puss in Boots', 'Hobbes', 'Stimpy']
Treats = ['Lasagne', 'Praise', 'Mice', 'Power', 'Calvin', 'Fresh kitty litter']

#FIX 2: Find location of selected cat (you need to insert the variable containing the cat-name)
CatIndex = Cats.index()

# FIX 3: Print cat name and favorite treat on screen (you need to add correct variables inside the print-function)
print("The favorite treat of","Garfield" , "is", Treats[]) #modify the code so that it works for any of the listed cats!
